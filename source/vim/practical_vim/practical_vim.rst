Introduction

Vim is an awesome piece of software. Many people love to hate it or worse, use
emacs(;-)).

Practical Vim is one of those amazing technical books which are page-turners and
you always want to keep reading ahead to find out what new thing you can learn
to improve your overall vim skills. But, the book is packed in with so much
information that I feel compelled to start making notes.

The whole book is primarily focuses on so called *tips* and I shall be making 
my notes along those lines.

UPDATE: My plan initially had been to keep writing notes as I went through Practical Vim. What is that they say about great plans and good intentions.

I have decided to make this my one stop place to put everything I learn about ViM.
