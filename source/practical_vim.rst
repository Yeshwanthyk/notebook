Practical Vim Notes
*******************

Vim is an awesome piece of software. Many people love to hate it or worse use
emacs(;-)).

Practical Vim is one of those amazing technical books which are page-turners and
you always want to keep reading ahead to find out what new thing you can learn
to improve your overall vim skills. But, the book is packed in with so much
information that I feel compelled to start making notes.

The whole book is primarily focuses on so called *tips* and I shall be making 
my notes along those lines.

    - The Dot command

      This command which is the **"."** on the keyboard basically repeats the last change.
      But, from the time I came across this in the book I have quickly come to realize
      this is for too powerful, because it does exacty what it advertises.

      The **"."** records the actions after we enter the *insert* mode.

      Another cool thing in this tip is the usage of **A**. What this basically does is,
      moves the cursor to the end of the line and switch into *insert* mode.

      The above two commands in combination can save one a lot of keystrokes.
