The Dot command
****************

This command which is the **"."** on the keyboard basically repeats the last change.
But, from the time I came across this in the book I have quickly come to realize
this is for too powerful, because it does exacty what it advertises.

The **"."** records the actions after we enter the *insert* mode.

Another cool thing in this tip is the usage of **A**. What this basically does is,
moves the cursor to the end of the line and switch into *insert* mode.

The above two commands in combination can save one a lot of keystrokes.
