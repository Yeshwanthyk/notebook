===============================

* Great co founders are very important. Should always cultivate a group.
* Don't make friends with people who you wouldn't want to start a company with.
* Its all about networking.
* Being your own boss sucks if you don't build anything of value.
* Building a product you love is crucial.
* Build something where you are the target audience.
* Build a company you want to keep.
* Don't complicate your work and hierarchy structure.
* In the early days, be clever only about your idea.
* It gets better but it also gets harder.
