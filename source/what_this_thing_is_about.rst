Inroduction
***********

`Sphinx`_. is an amazing software and I always wanted an excuse to use it and,
I got the excuse in the form of `Python guide`_. and `pydanny event notes`_.
and also when I found out how amazingly easy it is to set up and use `Read the
docs`_.

So, this is going to be a place I can put my personal notes. Or atleast, that
is my plan for now.
