==================
What is this about 
==================

`Sphinx`_. is an amazing software and I always wanted an excuse to use it and,
after seeing it being used for the amazing `Python guide`_. and also by `Pydanny`_ for `pydanny event notes`_,
I decided to go ahead and set it up for myself.

This is home for most of notes I make while moving from one book to another. You can reach me at `Yesh`_
and check out the code samples accompanying the notes on my `github`_ profile.
