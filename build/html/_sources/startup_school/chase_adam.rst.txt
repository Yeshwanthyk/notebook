Chase Adam (Watsi)
==================

This had to be one of the most inspiring talks in this year's startup school.
Watching his talk once its is up would be the best way to experience it. Nonetheless,
these are few of the many things he talked about.

* Fuck Non-profits
* Problem with being a Non-Profit. When you fundraise, no one says NO.
* Find something to work on that you care about, more than yourself.

I'll post a link to the talk in its entirety once its up.
